    <h1>The Old Bell Tower</h1>
    <p>Under the cloak of night, you arrive at the ancient Bell Tower. The air is thick with fog, masking the details of your surroundings. Suddenly, a figure steps out from the shadows, their face obscured. "You came. Good. We don't have much time," they say in a hushed tone.</p>
